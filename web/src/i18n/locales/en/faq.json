    {
      "question": "What exactly is AI automation in modular construction?",
      "answer": "It's using Artificial Intelligence to eliminate repetitive manual tasks in your construction company. For example: automatically classifying emails, extracting data from invoices with OCR, generating site reports by voice, controlling material stock, etc. These aren't physical robots or drones, but software automations that save 15-20 hours/week of administrative work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical knowledge or programming skills?",
      "answer": "No. We implement everything and train your team. The automations work with visual tools (no code) that anyone can use. If you know how to use WhatsApp or email, you know how to use our solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to implement an automation?",
      "answer": "It depends on complexity: Quick Wins (invoice OCR, email classification) are implemented in 3-7 days. More complex solutions (integrated dashboards, multiple automations) take 2-4 weeks. Never more than 1 month. No endless 6-12 month projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know I'll actually save money?",
      "answer": "In the initial Strategic Assessment, we calculate exact savings in euros based on your current processes. We deliver a report with projected ROI. Plus, we include a dashboard that shows real vs. projected savings in real time. If after 3 months you don't reach the projected ROI, we refine until it works or partially refund."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes ModulorIA different from other automation agencies?",
      "answer": "Three things: 1) We specialize 100% in modular construction (we know your specific processes). 2) We implement in weeks, not months (no endless projects). 3) No mandatory lock-in contracts (you pay per project or month to month). Other agencies are generic, slow, and tie you to annual contracts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with my current ERP/software or do I have to change everything?",
      "answer": "It integrates with your current systems. You don't have to change anything. We connect with your ERP, Google Sheets, Excel, WhatsApp, email, etc. The idea is to automate on top of what you already have, not replace everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there hidden or recurring costs after implementation?",
      "answer": "No hidden costs. The initial price includes everything (implementation + training + support). The tools we use have free or low-cost plans that run on your account. After the included support, you can contract optional maintenance or manage it yourself (we deliver everything documented)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my team resists the change?",
      "answer": "It's normal. That's why we do gradual onboarding: we start with 1-2 key people, demonstrate real results, then scale. Plus, our automations eliminate boring tasks (nobody misses transcribing invoices), so adoption is fast. We include ongoing training until everyone is comfortable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I start with something small and scale later?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. It's the recommended path. Start with a Quick Win like invoice OCR or email classification. See real results in 1-3 weeks. If it works (it always does), scale to bigger solutions. Bonus: If you hire High Impact after a successful Quick Win, we discount 100% of the Quick Win from the final price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer results guarantee?",
      "answer": "Yes. ROI Guarantee: If after 3 months you don't save at least double your investment, we do 2 free optimization sessions until it works. If the problem is technical on our end (bug, error), we fix it at no additional cost. If it simply doesn't work for your case (rare), we discuss it honestly and look for a solution or partial refund."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you implement AI in modular construction without disrupting operations?",
      "answer": "We work in parallel with your operations. We don't stop anything. We configure the automations in a test environment, validate them with your team, then activate them gradually. The transition is invisible to your clients and subcontractors. Your company keeps running normally while we implement."
